# wiiu-nand-thing
The wiiu-nand-thing is a flex PCB that is intended to make NAND replacements easier, specifically for the SLC.

The idea is to use two 512MB SLC NANDs. One of them will use the original NAND footprint (vWii/SLCCMPT), while the other will reside on this flex(SLC/Wii U). While it is possible to put the SLC NAND ontop of the SLCCMPT NAND (Piggybacking), that is very annoying to do, which is the entire reason this flex exists.

Yes I know it looks like a fish, and yes it is going to stay like that. I like it.

### Credits
YveltalGriffin: I stole the NAND footprint and some via footprints from the [cafeFlex repository](https://github.com/mackieks/cafeFlex).
